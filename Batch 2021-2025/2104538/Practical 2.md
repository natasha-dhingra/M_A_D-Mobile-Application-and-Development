**3. Understanding Basic Components of Android Studio**
   - Project Structure : The main components of your project will include:
     - Java/Kotlin Files : Located in the `app/src/main/java` directory. These files contain your appâ€™s source code.
     - XML Layout Files : Located in the `app/src/main/res/layout` directory. These files define the UI of your app.
     - AndroidManifest.xml : Located in the `app/src/main` directory. This file contains essential information about your app, including its components and permissions.

     - Open `MainActivity.java` or `MainActivity.kt` and write some basic code to handle UI interactions.
   - Run the App :
     - Click the "Run" button on the toolbar.
     - Choose a virtual device or connect a physical device via USB.
     - Android Studio will build and install the app on the selected device.

#### **2. Understanding Basic Components**

1. **Project Structure:**
   - **`app` Folder**: Contains your application code and resources.
     - **`java` Folder**: Contains Java or Kotlin source files.
     - **`res` Folder**: Contains resources like layouts, strings, and images.
     - **`AndroidManifest.xml`**: Declares application components and permissions.

2. **Gradle Build System:**
   - **`build.gradle` Files**: Manage project dependencies and build settings.
     - **Project-level `build.gradle`**: Configures global settings and repositories.
     - **Module-level `build.gradle`**: Manages dependencies and build configurations for the app module.

3. **Code Editor:**
   - **Editor Tabs**: Allows you to work with multiple files simultaneously.
   - **Code Assistance**: Features like code completion, linting, and error highlighting.

4. **Layout Editor:**
   - **Design Tab**: Visual editor for designing UI layouts using drag-and-drop.
   - **Code Tab**: Shows the XML code for the layout, which can be edited directly.

5. **Emulator:**
   - **Virtual Device**: Simulates an Android device for testing your application.
   - **Control Features**: Allows interaction with the app as if it were on a physical device.

6. **Logcat:**
   - **Log Output**: Displays runtime log messages for debugging.
   - **Filters**: Allows you to filter logs by level or tag.

7. **Run/Debug Configuration:**
   - **Run Button**: Launches the app on the emulator or connected device.
   - **Debug Button**: Starts the app in debug mode, allowing you to set breakpoints and inspect variables.

# Practical 1: Design Aspects of Development Environments - Android and iOS

## Android Development Environment

### 1. Programming Languages
- **Java**: Long-standing primary language for Android development.
- **Kotlin**: Endorsed by Google for new Android projects due to its modern features and Java interoperability.

### 2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- **Android Studio**: Official IDE for Android, built on IntelliJ IDEA, featuring code completion, debugging tools, and a robust layout editor.

### 3. Software Development Kit (SDK)
- **Android SDK**: Contains essential tools for building, testing, and debugging Android apps, including the Android emulator, platform tools, and various libraries.

### 4. Build System
- **Gradle**: The build automation system used in Android Studio for compiling, packaging, and managing project dependencies.

### 5. Emulator
- **Android Emulator**: Part of the Android SDK, it enables developers to run and test apps on virtual devices with varying configurations and Android versions.

### 6. User Interface Design
- **XML Layouts**: UI components are typically specified in XML files.
- **Jetpack Compose**: A contemporary toolkit for constructing native UI using declarative programming.

### 7. Frameworks and Libraries
- **Android Jetpack**: A collection of libraries, tools, and guidelines to help developers create high-quality apps more easily. It includes components like LiveData, ViewModel, Room, Navigation, and WorkManager.

### 8. Testing
- **JUnit**: Used for unit testing.
- **Espresso**: Utilized for UI testing.
- **Robolectric**: Facilitates running tests on the JVM without needing an emulator.

## iOS Development Environment

### 1. Programming Languages
- **Objective-C**: An older language used for iOS development.
- **Swift**: A modern language for iOS development, designed to be safe, fast, and expressive.

### 2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- **Xcode**: The official IDE for iOS development, featuring a code editor, debugger, and Interface Builder for designing user interfaces.

### 3. Software Development Kit (SDK)
- **iOS SDK**: Provides necessary tools and frameworks for developing iOS applications, including libraries like UIKit, Foundation, and Core Data.

### 4. Build System
- **Xcode Build System**: Built into Xcode for compiling, packaging, and managing dependencies.

### 5. Simulator
- **iOS Simulator**: Allows developers to test and debug applications on virtual devices with different iOS versions and configurations.

### 6. User Interface Design
- **Storyboard and XIB files**: Interface Builder within Xcode is used for visual UI design.
- **SwiftUI**: A modern declarative framework for building UI across all Apple platforms.

### 7. Frameworks and Libraries
- **Cocoa Touch**: The development environment for iOS apps, including frameworks like UIKit, Foundation, and Core Graphics.
- **Combine**: A framework for handling asynchronous events through event-processing operators.

### 8. Testing
- **XCTest**: Used for unit and UI testing.
- **Quick/Nimble**: Popular third-party frameworks for behavior-driven development (BDD).

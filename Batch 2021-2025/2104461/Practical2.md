  - Configuring other necessary components

## 2. Basic Components of Android Studio

### 2.1 Project Structure

- **Project View**: Displays the project's files and folders.
- **App Module**: Contains the app's source code and resources.

### 2.2 User Interface

- **Toolbar**: Provides access to project-related functions.
- **Editor Window**: The main area where you write code.
- **Tool Windows**: Panels like the Project window, Logcat, etc., that provide additional functionality.

### 2.3 Key Files and Directories

- **`AndroidManifest.xml`**: Declares app components and permissions.
- **`build.gradle`**: Scripts for configuring the build process.
- **`res/`**: Resource directory containing layouts, images, etc.
- **`src/`**: Contains Java/Kotlin source files.

### 2.4 Debugging and Testing

- **Logcat**: Displays system messages, including log messages from your app.
